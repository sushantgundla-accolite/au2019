# Angular Assignemnt - Employee App

### Things to know

- As I am a part of AU-Machine Learning training, we have not been given any training on the creation of api or any backend technologies. Hence I did not use any api for data.
- Instead I used json file which is locally stored for fetching the data
- Result of this, the data is deleted and updated untill the app is refreshed (As it is a SPA, moving from one component to other does not refresh the data)
